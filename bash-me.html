            <p>I have lived in six countries and graduated highschool in South Africa. I enjoy long walks on the virtual and imaginary beaches of vidoe games and books.</p>

            <h2>Web Technologies</h2>
            <p>I am not professionally experienced with web, but far off in the land of Notcollege, I think it would be fun to be a web developer. I have experience with JavaScript, jQuery, APIs, Firebase and have dipped my toes into React. I would like continue learning all the front end stuff I can and then perhaps get into the back end.</p>
